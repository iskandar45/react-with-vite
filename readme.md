# React with Vite

This is the README file for the React project created with Vite.

## Description

This project is a React application scaffolded with Vite, a fast and minimalist build tool for modern web development. It provides an optimized development experience with features like instant hot module replacement (HMR) and a fast bundler.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the project directory
- Install the dependencies
- Start the development server

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the production-ready app for deployment.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you can build the production-ready bundle using the following command:
`npm run build`

This will generate an optimized and minified bundle in the <code>dist</code> directory, which can be deployed to a
static file server or a hosting service of your choice.
